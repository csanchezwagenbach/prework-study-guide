# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Coding bootcamp prework offers prospective students a copious amount of information over the course of three distinct modules. A study guide webpage serves both to identify critical information and coalesce it all into a single resource. Building this project served the dual purpose of concretizing the lessons learned throughout the prework as well as assisting all prospective students with reviewing the content covered throughout the modules. While the modules are simple to navigate, there is no single resource emphasizing the most vital information presented. Additionally, this single webpage requires no more navigational skills than scrolling. Throughout the construction of the webpage, practice was afforded with three different programming languages: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS). Rudimentary employment of these languages ensured basic competence with their structure, content, inner logics, and interrelationships in web development. Additionally, the project served as an introduction to the GitHub community as well as best practices with respect to working in said community.

## Usage

The webpage displays information in four distinct sections corresponding with the four primary topics covered over the course of prework: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Users may find in each section the most critical information about these topics conveyed through the prework modules. Information has been condensed into list form for the convenience of prospective students looking for an opportunity to review. Additionally, using the DevTools console (Command+Option+I for macOS or Control+Shift+I Windows), users may see the operation of JavaScript which will list the four topics as well as offer a suggestion as to which topic a prospective student might review.
